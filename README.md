# Crypto CrowdFunding
A blockchain based crowd funding project developed with Solidity and ReactJS. 

This project was initially developed during an online course on blockchain development, and was extended to change the library web3.js
to ethers.js.  

The layout of the page is being changed as well as an API interface is to be inserted, so the users can store information and pictures about
their campaigns. 

The platform is running on the Rinkeby test network and is planned to be migrated to the Main Ethereum Network as soon as it has been thoroughly tested.
